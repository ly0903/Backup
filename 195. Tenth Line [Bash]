"""
How would you print just the 10th line of a file?
"""

# Bash

#1
awk 'NR == 10' file.txt

#NR: the current row number (start from 1).
#Because the default action of awk is {print $0}, we can ignore the action.


#2
sed -n '10p' file.txt

#'10p' should be seperated in 2 parts. '10' and 'p'
#'10' means the 10th line.
#'p' means print to stdout
# without -n, it prints out all the lines, plus the 10th line.
